*  Utility library for Marlin based (reconstruction) programs

-----------------------

Library that containes classes and functions that are used by more than
one processor. In particular it contains the geometry classes that are used
until we have the geometry for reconstruction package (GEAR).

This package is needed in praticular for MarlinReco but can also be included in other 
Marlin based programs.

The easisiest way to install and build MarlinUtil is to copy it into the 
$MARLINWORKDIR/packages directory and use the global toplevel Makefile of Marlin.

Further documentation can be found in the MarlinReco manual 
(http://ilcsoft.desy.de -> Software Packages -> MarlinReco -> Documentation )
